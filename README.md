Manpages for Tox

In this repository you can find the manpages for the toxcore and several tox-related projects, such as clients or bindings, where available

To display a manpage for testing view, cd to the directory and

   cd mandir/       # where mandir is the directory containing the manpage
   man ./toxic      # to open toxic's manpage called 'toxic'

Note it has no extension, but the files are formatted in the man-format.
